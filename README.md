ObjectiveRecord-iOS
===================

ObjectiveRecord is an asynchronous, ARC enabled ORM library written in Objective-C that makes consuming REST web services very easy.

## Dependencies ##

The only dependency ObjectiveRecord has is [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking "AFNetworking"), make sure to install it along with ObjectiveRecord.

## Installation ##

+ First git clone this repository.

```git
git clone git@github.com:epastor/ObjectiveRecord-iOS.git
```

+ Drag & Drop the ObjectiveRecord-iOS folder to your project in XCode, make sure to un-check the copy files option, this way it will be easier to keep ObjectiveRecord updated across all your projects.

+ That's it, if you already installed [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking "AFNetworking") you're good to go!
